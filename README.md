This project is a farming and crafting game. All requirements for Project 3 have been completed.


## Controls
#### WASD
* Player movement
#### Left-click mouse
* For using tools and planting seeds
#### Right-click mouse
* Interact with objects, plants and animals on the map
#### Number keys (1-9)
* Can be used to equip items from the backpack; clicking on the backpack slot with the mouse also equips the item. The delete button on the right deletes the currently equipped item.

## How to play
* Start by choosing a character.
* The player starts on the farm map where they can pick up debris. These items can be used to craft tools and other items using the crafting table.
* The forest map has more plants that can be foraged and used for crafting. To gather wood from trees, an axe must be equipped.
* The animal map has chickens and cows that the player can interact with to show a heart. Chickens walk randomly around the map.
* Sleeping refreshes the resources in the forest.

### Farming
* Seeds can only be planted on tillable land on the farm map.
* The hoe tool must first be used to till the grassland. The resulting tilled plot can be watered and a seed can be planted in it.
* The plant will grow the next day and can be harvested.
