By Rheeca Guion

This project is a crafting and gathering game.


## Controls
#### WASD
* Player movement
#### Left-click mouse
* If a tool is equipped, the tool is used
#### Right-click mouse
* Interact with objects and animals on the map
#### Number keys (1-9)
* Can be used to equip items from the backpack; clicking on the backpack slot with the mouse can also equip the item

## How to play
* Start by choosing a character.
* The player starts on the farm map where they can pick up debris. These items can be used to craft tools and other items using the crafting table.
* The forest map has more plants that can be foraged and used for crafting. To gather wood from trees, an axe must be equipped.
* The animal map has chickens and cows that the player can interact with to show a heart. Chickens walk randomly around the map.
* Sleeping refreshes the resources in the forest.
